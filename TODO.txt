mbtiles-converter
- row major means XYZ schema not TMS -> refactor the createIndexInRowMajorOrder method in the indexFactory module
  to use XYZ scheme which is also specified in the OGC WebMercatorQuad
- Use prepared statements in the getTilesByRowMajorOrderBatched method of the MbTilesRepository class
- Use a worker pool to parallelize the conversion -> replace sqlite3 with better-sqlite3 for worker support
- TileMatrixSetBuilder -> define name of the supported crs in the JSON schema
- MetadataBuilder -> Add additional attributes of a mbtiles database e.g. pxel_scale, name, description, id, json with the vector layers
- IndexFactory doesn't scale because the index is stored in memory
- index module
  -> return index and tile via generator and write batches at once in a file
  -> not all tiles in the lower zoom levels are queried because the bounds are calculated
